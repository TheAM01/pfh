                Parhle Warna Fail Hojayega, Parhle&semi; Fail Hojayega or PWFH for short, is a small-scale, self-hosted website made to provide free notes & resources to students.
                Given the lack of resources and study material on the web, it is difficult to find sufficient amount of material to study.
                The immediate solution would be to buy notes from a local store but PWFH solves this problem.
                We provide free notes from trusted sources for absolute zero cost that can be downloaded from our server & then printed or just used to study digitally.
                We protect you from the hassle of finding notes. We keep them sorted by category on our website where they can be accessed easily within seconds.
                <a href="/login">Log in</a> or <a href="/register">sign up</a> to get studying or continue without an account.
                Our resources include Practical Centre, Adamjee Coaching and several others. Check <a href="/sources">our sources</a> for a list of sources from where we obtain notes.
